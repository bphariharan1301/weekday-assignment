# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation and Usage Steps

You can run this project in your local server by following the steps mentioned below:-

1. ##### Installing the necessary packages
    > `npm install ` or `npm i `
2. ##### Run the server:
    > `npm start`

The Server will open in the port `3000` and you can access it by going to `localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3000` in your preferred browser.

## To Test the Functionalities in live server:

This project is also live [here](https://weekday-assignment-hariharanbp.vercel.app/) and is hosted [vercel](https://vercel.com)

### Features Implemented

This react-app has the feature mentioned in the Assignment docs but not limited to the docs.

Some of the Requirements which are implemented are as follows:

-   Job Cards::

    -   Job title
    -   Company name
    -   Location
    -   Job description (limited to a certain number of characters with an option to expand)
    -   Experience required
    -   Apply button/link

-   Filters:

    -   Min experience
    -   Company name
    -   Location
    -   Remote/on-site
    -   Tech stack
    -   Role
    -   Min base pay

-   Infinite Scroll
-   Responsive Design

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
